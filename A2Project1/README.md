A role playing game. Basically infinite loop of battle and rest. No graphic. Command line rpg.

A living weapon thirst for power and found a random human to hold it. But on the main menu character will still be shown as hero lol.

Battle to gain exp and money. Money can be used to by heal upgrade weapon and armor. After each battle player choose if use money to buy healing,item or upgrading. Character have no exp and cannot level up, only weapon can. level up increase basic stats. Upgrading gives weapon skill or more stats. Player can hold ifinite number of items and weapon skills, but can only install one at a time. battle system: ATTACK, DEFENCE, WEAPON SKILL, ITEM, each turn player choose one command. Player can choose different jobs and each job have different weapon (while only name have difference)

Still working on it and now it's full of bugs.
